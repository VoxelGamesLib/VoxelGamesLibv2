# VoxelGamesLib v2

Powerful, feature-packed, abstract and expandable Minecraft minigames framework.

> WIP! THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. Not all features are currently implemented. Feel free to contribute!

This will be a large-scaled, fully-modular and well-documented minigames API.

# Building

its maven, go figure.
install also installs the jar into /testserver/plugins, if you don't want that use package.

# Dev Setup

the test server is packaged with the server. 
you just need to grab a spigot jar and create a run config like this:

(important stuff: single instance only, run mvn install, change working dir to test server)
